description: 'Full-Stack Project Management Platform for Development Teams'
slug: 'atelier'
---

A project management platform designed to streamline how development teams work together by bringing task tracking, team communication, and project analytics into one unified workspace.

## The Problem

Development teams often juggle multiple disconnected tools‚Äîone for messaging, another for task tracking, and yet another for metrics. This fragmentation creates information gaps and makes it harder to maintain project visibility. Atelier addresses this by providing a single platform where teams can manage their entire workflow.

## Key Features

**üîê Authentication & Access Control**  
Argon2 password hashing with JWT token-based sessions. Role-based permissions system (Admin, Project Manager, Developer, Team Member) controls access to project resources. Automated email notifications for password resets and task assignments.

**üìä Real-Time Collaboration**  
Shared Kanban boards with instant updates via WebSocket connections‚Äîdrag a task and everyone sees it move immediately. Integrated chat keeps discussions in context with the relevant tasks. Visual analytics track sprint progress and identify bottlenecks.

**‚ö° Technical Architecture**  
Node.js/Express.js backend following MVC patterns with RESTful APIs. MongoDB for flexible document storage using Atlas for cloud hosting. Optimized database queries with proper indexing and efficient real-time event handling through Socket.io.

## Technical Implementation

The tech stack was chosen for practical reasons: **Node.js** handles concurrent connections well (crucial for real-time features), **MongoDB** allows schema flexibility during rapid development, and **JWT authentication** keeps the system stateless and scalable.

Each API endpoint validates permissions through custom middleware. When someone updates a Kanban board, WebSocket events broadcast minimal data updates rather than full refreshes, keeping the system responsive even with multiple concurrent users.

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Synchronizing multiple clients without overwhelming the server  
**Solution**: Implemented event throttling and delta updates‚Äîsending only changed data instead of full state refreshes

**Challenge**: Managing complex permission logic across different roles  
**Solution**: Centralized authorization middleware that validates permissions before any database operation

## Current Status

**Working Features:**

- User registration/login with secure authentication
- Project creation and team member management
- Drag-and-drop Kanban boards with real-time updates
- Basic chat system within project context
- Role-based access control across all features

**In Development:**

- Enhanced analytics dashboard with actionable metrics
- Performance optimization for larger teams
- Mobile responsive UI improvements

This ongoing project demonstrates practical application of full-stack development concepts while solving real team collaboration challenges.
