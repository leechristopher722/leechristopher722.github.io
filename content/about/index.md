## Beyond Code 🌟

When I'm not coding, you'll find me behind the bar mixing up creative cocktails for my friends—I love experimenting with different spirits and flavors to come up with something completely new. I'm also constantly exploring San Francisco's food scene, from hole-in-the-wall spots to trendy new restaurants, and I'm always on the mission to find the city's most amazing coffee shops.

Whether it's perfecting a new cocktail recipe or discovering an amazing restaurant together, I love bringing people together over great food and drinks. These moments of connection and creativity keep me energized and inspired, both in life and in my work.
